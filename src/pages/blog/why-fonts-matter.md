We all know learning a new technology is quite uneasy, but it is really cool and interesting to learn a new technology. We have different types of programming languages (more than 500) and we have different learning resources too. There are different programming languages in different sections of development, we have web development, software development and even application development. This article will teach you the things that developers should do before learning how to code a new programming language:

Developers should get a required IDE before learning a new technology: This will help developers to be familiar with the language that they are learning. It will help developers to practice while learning the new programming language. For example Python needs an IDE like PyCharm or Spyder before you can write a code and debug an application.

Developers should make a deep research on the programming language they are learning: Developers should find out about the programming language they are learning by finding out how tough the language is to get them prepared. Developers should know what they are going into in order for them not to get into problems while learning and after learning the new programming language. For example we all know C++ is a tough language and it requires a lot of time while learning and after learning, developers should spend more time on making research about the programming language.

Developers should have a place where they write the keywords of the language: They should also have a book where they write keywords the definitions are not also left out. Developers should also know how to use the keywords. The first thing they should know while learning how to write a programming language is the basic syntax. For example, the basic syntax of C++ is:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
In conclusion, all developers should have a very good way of learning and they should also follow the steps that are mentioned here. You will find it very easy while learning a new technology while using this steps.
